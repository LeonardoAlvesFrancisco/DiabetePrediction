<p>Abstract:</p>
Data analysis is a fundamental step in any project involving data. It enables you to understand the dataset, draw conclusions, and make decisions based on concrete information. In the case of a diabetes dataset, data analysis can help identify patterns and trends in the data, assess the impact of certain variables on disease control, and create models to predict the risk of complications.

<p>
1. Initially we review the data and try to understand what it represents, as well as its variables and whether there are any missing values.</br>
2. I perform data cleaning, as it is important to remove missing and incorrect information within the dataset.</br>
3. I explore the data using graphs and other data visualization tools to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends.</br>
4. I perform a statistical test to evaluate the significance of the relationships between variables and confirm or refute hypotheses about the data set.</br>
5. I use machine learning techniques to create models that can predict the risk of complications in patients with diabetes based on variables such as age, blood glucose, and blood pressure.</br>
6. And finally with the predictive model ready we use the results of the data analysis to draw conclusions and make informed decisions about how to treat and manage each patient's diabetes.</br>
